# A two-dimensional obstruction for maps affine in one variable

Consider a plane polynomial map

`G(x, y) = (a(x) * y + b(x), c(x) * y + d(x))`.

Its Jacobian determinant is affine in `y`; its two coefficients are

`a' * c - a * c'` and `b' * c - a * d'`.

This module proves that if the determinant is a nonzero constant, then both
`a'` and `c'` vanish. Over a characteristic-zero field, `a` and `c` are
therefore constants. Thus a two-dimensional counterexample cannot arise from
this direct analogue of the announced three-dimensional map's affine-in-`z`
shape.

## Main results

- `affineInY_slopes_derivative_eq_zero`: the `y`-slopes have zero derivative.
- `affineInY_slopes_constant`: in characteristic zero, those slopes are
  constant polynomials.
- `affineInY_injective`: the resulting plane map is injective.

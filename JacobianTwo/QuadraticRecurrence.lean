# Coefficient recurrence for a centered quadratic coordinate

This file isolates the coefficient calculation used after passing to the
fraction field in the variable-leading quadratic case.  Let `D` be a
derivation of a characteristic-zero field `L`, and regard `B` as a polynomial
in an outer indeterminate `Q`.  From

`2 * (Q - F) * D(B) - D(F) * B = C`

we extract the leading-coefficient equation, the full downward recurrence,
and the terminal constant-coefficient equation.  Here `D(B)` means that `D`
is applied coefficientwise; the outer indeterminate is held constant.

/-- Every positive-degree coefficient equation yields the downward recurrence

`D(b_j) = F * D(b_(j+1)) + (D(F) / 2) * b_(j+1)`.

Writing the positive index as `j + 1` makes the formula total: coefficients
above the degree of `B` are automatically zero. -/

# Jacobian identities for the quadratic parity decomposition

This file isolates the chain-rule cancellation behind

`P = H(Q) + U * B(Q)`.

The coefficient derivation holds the outer indeterminate `U` fixed.  The
resulting Jacobian with `Q` forgets the derivatives of `H` and `B` with respect
to their argument; only their coefficientwise derivatives survive.

# Extracting the two parts of the centered quadratic Jacobian

The centered Jacobian identity splits canonically into a polynomial in
`eps * X ^ 2 + F` and `X` times another such polynomial.  If the Jacobian is
constant, uniqueness of this parity decomposition makes the odd coefficient
vanish and identifies the even coefficient with the quadratic recurrence.
